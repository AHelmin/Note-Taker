/*
  If you require() a json file:
   Javascript will automatically convert to an object for you 
   BUT, the file is only read ONCE, so if you update the file, Express won't know it 

  If you use fs.readFile()
    Javascript will NOT automatically convert to an object for you 
    BUT, the file is re-read every time you call the fs.readFile() method 
*/

always use res.json to return files
